# Wavether Inc. Privacy Policy

Wavether Inc. (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our cloud-based software products (“apps”), support services (“service”), and public website (“site”) maintained by Wavether Inc. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of our Site or our Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” **Non-Personal Information** includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. **Personal Information** includes your email and contact information, which you submit to us through the registration process or marketing submissions at the Site.

### 1.1. Wavether Apps

The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.

Our Atlassian Cloud apps operate entirely on Atlassian infrastructure. All Data within the app is confined within Atlassian services local to your Atlassian instance. We collect basic information around installation and uninstallation of the apps for business purposes. When you install the app, none of the information stored on your IT system is accessible to us. Furthermore, the app neither sends data from your IT system nor from the end-user to us or any third party.

### 1.2. Wavether Site

Our site uses Google Analytics and Tag Manager to collect information helpful to us to understand how users access our site. Google Analytics uses cookies and other means to collect the necessary information to Google services for the function of analytics. Google relies on the European Commission’s [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) for transfers of online advertising and measurement of personal data out of the European Economic Area. Information collected through Google is used to help us improve the functions and services provided by our site.

### 1.3. Information you provide us by installing our apps

In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you install an App or use our service to become a subscriber to the Service you will be registering to our service. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 2. How We Use And Share Information

### 2.1. Personal Information

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.

We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

### 2.2. Non-Personal Information

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service, Apps, and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.

In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

## 3. How We Protect Information

Although achieving 100% information safety is impossible, we prioritize privacy and implement numerous measures to mitigate risks, such as:

- Employing TLS and HSTS protocols when gathering data from your interactions with our services.

- Restricting access to our company information and customer information.

- Deploying industry security best practices across any systems we use.

- Maintain and enforce a company defined data retention policy such that we only retain information as long as it relates to maintaining our relationship with you, under obligation to any regulations, and removing content once a retention period or reasonable use case has expired.

## 4. Your Rights Regarding The Use Of Your Personal Information

You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing communications by reaching us at [info@wavether.com](mailto:info@wavether.com). Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy or any that are necessary to continue the function of any support or service of any of our apps you use.

## 5. Links To Other Websites

As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service. To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.

The Company reserves the right to change this policy and our Terms of Service at any time. We will notify you of significant changes to our Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
